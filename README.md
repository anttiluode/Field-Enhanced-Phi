# Field-Enhanced Phi

Field-Enhanced Phi is an innovative project that integrates dynamic field layers with transformer-based neural networks, specifically leveraging the Phi-3.5-mini model. By overlaying fractal-like field structures atop traditional neural architectures, this project enhances learning efficiency and fosters creative and non-local information processing. Field-Enhanced Phi achieves up to a 7% improvement in training efficiency and introduces novel mechanisms for creativity and insight generation through field-mediated interactions.

# Key Features:

Dynamic Field Layers: Implements fractal-like, wave-inspired field layer that interact with transformer hidden states to enhance information flow and learning efficiency.

Gradio Interface: Provides an intuitive Gradio-based UI for adjusting field parameters such as field size, coupling strength, and injection points, enabling real-
time experimentation and visualization.

# Getting Started:

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/anttiluode/Field-Enhanced-Phi.git 

cd field-enhanced-phi

pip install torch transformers gradio plotly numpy mne scipy anyio matplotlib

# Run the Interface:

python app.py 

Experiment: Use the Gradio interface to adjust field parameters and observe their effects on the Phi modelâ€™s performance and creativity.

Errors at 32x32 so use 16x16 for field size
